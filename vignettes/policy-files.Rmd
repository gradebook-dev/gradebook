There are two ingredients that are needed to calculate course grades with `gradebook`: a data frame containing assignment scores and a file that encodes the grading policies often described in a syllabus. We call that file a *policy file*.

Policy files are stored as [.yaml](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started) files, a simple format for storing hierarchical data in a text file with minimal markup. Here is an example of a policy file for a course with a fairly simple grading scheme.

```yaml
`r xfun::file_string(system.file("extdata", "simple_policy.yaml", package = "gradebook"))`
```

Once you have written your policy file, you can read it into R as a list.

```{r}
yaml::read_yaml(system.file("extdata", "simple_policy.yaml", package = "gradebook"))
# to be replaced with gradebook::read_policy()
```
